# Client Privilege and Trust Model

> Part of the [docs index](./README.md). Related: [admin panel](./admin-panel.md) · [features](./features.md) · [environment variables](./environment-variables.md).

Open interoperability without automatically trusting unknown applications.

**Governing principle:** open registration, limited default authority, explicit user consent, earned trust, and immediate revocation.

## Trust tiers

| Tier | Key | How it is assigned | Default authority |
|------|-----|--------------------|-------------------|
| 0 Unknown | `unknown` | Dynamic client registration | Public scopes, mandatory consent, PKCE, no M2M, no consent bypass |
| 1 Developer | `developer` | Verified developer account / admin | Higher limits; still requires consent |
| 2 Verified | `verified` | Admin review | Private scopes (e.g. `offline_access`), verified badge |
| 3 Partner | `partner` | Contractual approval | Machine scopes / `client_credentials` |
| 4 First-party | `first_party` | Explicit admin config only | Consent bypass for approved scopes; never via DCR |

Stored in private OAuth client `metadata` (not editable through public DCR):

```json
{
  "trustTier": "verified",
  "verifiedDomain": "example.com",
  "reviewedAt": "2026-08-02T20:12:00-04:00",
  "reviewedBy": "admin-user-id",
  "riskLevel": "standard"
}
```

Promotion is an **administrative** operation (`promoteClientTrustTier`). Clients cannot promote themselves by changing registration metadata.

## Scopes in this starter

| Scope | Category | Min tier to assign |
|-------|----------|--------------------|
| `openid` | Public | unknown |
| `profile` | Public | unknown |
| `email` | Public | unknown |
| `offline_access` | Private | verified |

Protocol-specific scopes (Nostr, AT Proto, wallet, MCP tool groups) are reserved for future resources; the evaluation rules below still apply when those scopes are added.

## Dynamic registration (Tier 0)

Controlled by `ALLOW_DYNAMIC_CLIENT_REGISTRATION` (default off). When enabled:

- Clients are stamped `trustTier: "unknown"`
- Only public scopes may be requested
- `client_credentials` is rejected
- PKCE is required; `skip_consent` cannot be set (enforced by Better Auth + our wrapper)
- Redirect URIs must be HTTPS (localhost excepted)
- Confidential client secrets expire (`30d` by default)

Unauthenticated public registration remains behind `ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED_CLIENT_REGISTRATION`.

## Privilege evaluation

Every protected API call should satisfy:

```text
client may request the scope
AND user granted the scope
AND token contains the scope
AND token audience matches the resource
AND user is authorized for the resource
AND client trust tier permits the operation
AND request is within rate / risk limits
```

A valid OAuth token does not authorize every action.

## Registration vs runtime privileges

| Registration | Runtime |
|--------------|---------|
| Create / update / delete clients | Read or write user data |
| Manage redirect URIs & credentials | Call MCP tools / adapters |
| View secrets (admin) | Background / offline access |

Permission to register a client does **not** grant access to user data.

## Consent UX

Unknown and developer clients show an **Unverified application** warning on `/consent`. Verified and above show a verified badge. First-party clients may skip consent when `skipConsent` is set by an admin.

## Admin controls

On `/admin/clients/[id]`:

- Set trust tier (promotion / demotion)
- `skipConsent` only when tier is `first_party`
- `client_credentials` only when tier is `partner` or `first_party`
- Scopes filtered to those allowed for the selected tier

## Revocation

Use existing admin disable/delete plus Better Auth token revocation. Users can revoke grants from account settings. Future work: per-grant audit UI, developer suspension, global scope kill-switches.

## Recommended default policy

```text
Unknown: open DCR (when enabled), public scopes, consent, PKCE, short secrets, no M2M
Verified: private scopes, verified badge, longer refresh with consent
Partner: admin-approved M2M and organization scopes
First-party: explicitly configured, optional consent bypass
```
